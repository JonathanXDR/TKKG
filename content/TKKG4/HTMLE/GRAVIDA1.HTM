    Well-informed sources tell us that Mr Gradiva, father of Eric, the kidnap victim, received
    a ransom demand for 100,000 pounds from the blackmailers in yesterday´s post. <br>
    No details were available about either the time or the place for the ransom handover. Last
    Saturday, the news of the kidnapping of little Eric Gradiva shattered the peace of our
    little town.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica">Mrs
    Gradiva, who was looking after her stepson at the time, told the STAR: &quot;I was
    sitting with both my lovely babies in the garden. Eric was playing happily in the
    sand-pit. Axel was asleep in his pram. I just popped into the house to get sun-hats for
    the two boys and when I came back, Eric was gone! At first I though he was playing
    hide-and-seek, but I soon realised there was something terribly wrong.&quot; And there was
    - Eric had been kidnapped.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica">A letter from the kidnappers arrived on Monday morning,
     with a lock of the child´s hair. Then, just awful silence until the letter
    yesterday. The police haven´t a clue. Inspector Marsh said they still haven´t found any
    trace of the kidnappers.</font></p>
