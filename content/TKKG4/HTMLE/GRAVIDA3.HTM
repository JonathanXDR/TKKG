    <br>On Monday, Mr Gradiva, owner and managing director of the PALM works, called in the
    official receivers. At the press conference, Mr Gradiva explained:<br>
    &quot;For many years, we led the market in men´s and boy´s clothing. Now, it seems that
    our conservative style is no longer in demand. The PALM works are closing their
    gates and the Gradiva family is withdrawing from the textile manufacturing business.&quot;
    <br>
    Many a tear was shed at a meeting of workers when Mr Gradiva announced the immediate
    closure of the plant. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica">&quot;We´ve always been like a
    family&quot;, Simone Dyer (53), a seamstress at the factory from the age of 15, said.
    Well-informed sources are quoted as saying that takeover negotiations with market leader
    C&amp;B Brinkelhuber have already started. A result is expected at the beginning of next
    week. </font></p>
