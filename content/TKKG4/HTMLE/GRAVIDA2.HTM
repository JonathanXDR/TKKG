    &quot;It´s as if the earth had opened up and swallowed Eric whole&quot;, said inspector
    March yesterday at the police´s special unit press conference about their investigations
    into Eric´s disappearance. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica">Until now, police have found no
    trace of the kidnappers. Police units have been asking neighbours on the lake. People
    paddling and using sailing boats have been asked to report to the police. But no-one saw
    anything suspicious. The police are assuming that this is the work of a gang of highly
    specialised criminals. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica">The location had been so carefully
    reconnoitred in advance that the kidnappers were able to pull off the crime completely undetected.
    &quot;This is undoubtedly the work of professionals&quot;, said Marsh in conclusion. He is
    hoping that, with the help of Interpol, an exact criminal profile can be put together in
    the next few days.</font></p>
